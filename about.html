        <p>My name is Chris Jones, and this is the story of my journey, thus far. I was always fascinated by technology,
             and have been of a curious mind when it comes to the inner workings of technology. I worked as a Master Diagnostic
              Technician (MDT) for local Toyota dealerships, where I started as an apprentice mechanic. Eventually, I became highly
               recognized in the Toyota community for my understanding of mechanical and electrical systems, and the logic circuits governing
                those systems. After several years, although I was earning a competitive salary at the Toyota dealership, I found an opportunity at
                 the local utility company, MLGW, which offered a far more comprehensive benefits package, and a better work/life
                  balance, albeit for slightly less income. I accepted the position, and after adjusting to a new environment, 
                  I again earned a reputation for having a strong diagnostic and problem solving ability, especially given the wide array of
                   equipment and responsibility. I was in a secure position, and had a highly sought after governnment job, but I found myself 
                  looking for a new challenge.   
        </p>
        <p>The epiphany came to me while at MLGW that I would attain greater job satisfaction in a field which was centered in 
            ideas more so than jobs which had a strong labor component. As someone who considers the future, I also realized that 
            intellectual fields are generally associated with a higher length of service when contrasted with traditional trades.
             With this in mind, I began studying mechanical engineering, while also working full-time at MLGW. I was also living far below 
             my means in an effort to build my savings. After a few of years of picking away at my courses, my savings and investments 
             reached a point that I had sufficient resources to complete my degree as a full-time student, without being dependent on a
              paycheck. I also had a very supporting spouse (and still have), who received an offer at a company in Houston, TX, so I
               decided to resign my position, cash in my investments and savings, and complete my schooling in Texas. Although I was still maintaining a 4.0 
               through chemistry, calculus, etc., I did a spreadsheet analysis comparing web development to mechanical engineering, 
               taking into account the cost of schooling, absence from the work force, time until peak income, etc., and an aspiring 
               web developer was born! I began learning web technologies through a comprehensive approach, including books, online 
               courses, and YouTube tutorials. I also discovered that I truly enjoy implementing algorithms and solving problems
                using technology. More recently, I used some of my remaining capital to invest in UT Houston Coding Bootcamp. As 
                of this writing, the course is just beginning, but I'm excited about the possibilities!  </p>

        <h3>What I Do</h3>
        <p>As of this point, I am confident in my knowlege of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, and mySQL. That being said,
             the rate at which the preferred technologies change makes the ability to learn and implement new techology more desirable
              than static knowledge, which rapidly becomes obsolete when technologies fade from the limelight. I am committed to lifelong learning, 
            which I enjoy. I am willing to tackle any project for which I can access resources to complete. If an individual or business requests 
            a service in which I lack experience, I am willing to negotiate on price to compensate for the longer build time. I build everything from 
        simple responsive websites to complex AI implementations using the mini-max algorithm, most often combined with alpha-beta pruning. I can write 
    server side scripts to process your data in mySQL or similar database management systems. As mentioned in the 'About' section, I'm currently a 
    student of the UT Houston Coding Bootcamp, so my skills list will be updated over the proceeding months.    </p>
